Features:
- make i possible to inject a script tools file, which can be reused accros cmp-rules.
  The rule should optionally have toolScript property. If set, inject the file

- If screenshot is not enabled an none of the rules requires images loaded, make it possible
  to disable image loading:  https://www.scrapehero.com/how-to-increase-web-scraping-speed-using-puppeteer/
  For each base-rule make a property imagesRequired: default true. If none of the rules requires images and
  screenshot i disabled, don't load the images

- maybe set another user-agent, which at least hasn't got "Headless" in the name

- Partitioning of screenshot dir. Only if necessary.
  - Will only work if id's are used instead of url-filenames.
  - Use each letter in the id-alphabet as name for a folder (36 letters).
  - calculate the depth e.g.
    calculateDirPartitionDepth(maxFilesPrDir, totalFiles, alphabetSize) {
      let capacity = maxFilePrDir;
      let partitionDepth = 0;
      while (capacity < totalFiles) {
         capacity *= alphabetSize;
        partitionDepth++;
      }

      return partitionDepth;
    }
  - Create the dirs as needed.
  - Make a config.json which saves the partitionDepth in the project path, so we
    can use this for resumes (passing in a folder with existing data)
