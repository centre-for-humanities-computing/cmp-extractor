Features:
- make i possible to inject a script tools file, which can be reused accros cmp-rules.
  The rule should optionally have toolScript property. If set, inject the file

- If screenshot is not enabled an none of the rules requires images loaded, make it possible
  to disable image loading:  https://www.scrapehero.com/how-to-increase-web-scraping-speed-using-puppeteer/
  For each base-rule make a property imagesRequired: default true. If none of the rules requires images and
  screenshot i disabled, don't load the images

- maybe set another user-agent, which at least hasn't got "Headless" in the name

- Partitioning of screenshot dir. Only if necessary. Write down algorithm .... (pending).
  Will only work if id's are used instead of url-filenames.
